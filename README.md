# MNIST Classification with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Optimizer and Cross-Entropy Loss

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the SGD optimizer and cross-entropy loss.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a widely-used benchmark dataset in machine learning, consisting of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to create a neural network model that can accurately classify these images into their respective digit classes.
